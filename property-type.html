        <h2>Understanding Property Type Trends</h2>
        <p>
          This section explores how different categories of real estate have
          performed across Connecticut. From single-family homes to condos and
          commercial properties, we look at both how often they are sold and how
          their prices vary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once visualizations are added, you'll be able to interact with the
          data to see which property types are most active in the market, and
          how sale prices are distributed within each group.

        <h3>Sales Volume by Property Type</h3>
        <div class="viz-description">
          This bar chart shows the number of sales for each property type. Users
          can filter by the dates of the sales to see how the number of sales
          has changed over time. This helps highlight which types of properties
          are most popular, consistently in demand, and which may have
          experienced growth or decline in popularity over the years.

            >*Please note that many home sale records did not have a record of
            the property type - those have been filtered out in an effort to
            only report accurate information.*</i

        <div class="section-intro">
          Looking at the visualization above, we can see that the most commonly
          sold property type, across all years available (4/5/1999 - 8/31/2023),
          is Single Family homes, with a total of 401,612 sales. This is
          followed quickly by <i>other</i> residential properties.
          Unsurprisingly, the second least common property type sold is
          industrial real estate, with only 774 sales recorded. This makes sense
          considering most individuals aren't in a position to purchase
          industrial-grade properties, which are typically owned by businesses.
          Their high median sale price, as seen in the
          <a href="#viz-2" class="custom-link">next visualization</a>, also
          contributes to their limited number of transactions. You'll also
          notice "Public Utility" is the least common property type sold, with
          only 10 sales recorded. This is likely due to the fact that public
          utilities are typically owned/managed by the government, or there are
          limited public utility properties available for sale across the state.

        <h3>Sale Price Distribution by Property Type (Box Plot)</h3>
        <div class="viz-description">
          This box-and-whisker plot highlights the distribution of sale prices
          across the different property types. The box plots will show the
          median, quartiles, and outliers for each category, helping users
          understand the typical price ranges and variability in pricing for
          each type of real estate. Users will be able to filter by the dates of
          the sales to see how the median sale prices and distributions have
          changed over time. The max sales price filter can be adjusted to
          include higher or lower sales and exclude more or less outliers,
          allowing users to see how the distribution of sale prices changes when
          outliers are included or excluded (a higher maximum sales price will
          include more outliers).

          Looking at the visualization above, we can see that the median sale
          price for Single Family homes is higher than that of Two and Three
          Family homes. This may not be surprising, as single-family homes often
          come with more land and privacy, which can drive up their value (more
          people want to purchase them). However, something interesting depicted
          by the box-and-whisker plots is the broad category of "Residential"
          property types has a much higher median price than Single Family, Two
          Family, and Three Family homes, suggesting that the "Residential"
          category may include high-value property types beyond standard homes.
