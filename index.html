        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to analyze real estate data from the
          state of Connecticut to try to understand how the market has changed
          over time and how different property types have performed. The dataset
          includes information on property sales, including sale prices,
          property types, and locations, allowing me to create multiple
          different interesting visualizations. The data was obtained from the
          State of Connecticut, through Data.Gov and can be found

          The project is divided into two main sections: Market Changes Over
          Time and Property Type Insights. The market changes over time page
          explores how the real estate market in Connecticut has evolved over
          the years. Different features of the dataset are visualized to show
          trends in sale prices over time, the number of sales in different
          towns/zip-codes within Connecticut, how the market has reacted to
          inflation or deflation. To represent the changes in inflation and
          deflation, I was able to use the Consumer Price Index for All Urban
          Consumers (CPI-U) data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (via
          FRED - the Federal Reserve Economic Data provided by the St. Louis FED
          branch) to show how inflation and deflation change year to year, and
          if those changes are visible in the real estate market. That data can
          be found
          <a
            class="custom-link"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www1.ctdol.state.ct.us/lmi/cpi.asp"
            >here</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s important to note that all of the CPI-U data across my project
          shows the change in CPI-U year-over-year. This means that if the CPI-U
          was 1.5% in 2020 and 2.5% in 2021, the change in CPI-U would be 1.0%
          (2.5% - 1.5%). This approach was used to help highlight how the rate
          of inflation was changing from one year to the next, rather than just
          showing the total level of inflation. While not every visualization in
          the project is focused on percent change, several of them are —
          especially those that explore how prices or economic conditions
          shifted annually. Because of that, I wanted to keep the format
          consistent and make it easier to directly compare changes over time.
          It’s also important to understand that the CPI-U line in the
          visualizations <i>does not show the actual CPI-U value</i>, but
          instead <i>shows the change in CPI-U from the previous year</i>. If
          the CPI-U line appears negative, it means that the inflation rate
          decreased compared to the year before (not necessarily that prices
          dropped overall, but that the increase in prices slowed down).
          However, if the CPI-U line drops below the x-axis, that indicates a
          negative change in inflation (meaning actual deflation occurred during
          that year).

          The Property Type Insights section focuses on how different categories
          of real estate (such as single family homes, general residential real
          estate, etc.) have performed over time across Connecticut. This part
          of the project uses visualizations to break down the number of
          property sales by category, as well as to explore the distribution of
          sale prices within each category. These visualizations help reveal
          which types of properties are the most commonly sold and how their
          values vary, giving potential buyers, sellers, and investors a better
          understanding of the market for each category. In particular, the bar
          chart shows which property types are the most active in the market
          over time, while the box-and-whisker plot illustrates the spread of
          sale prices, including medians and outliers. This section helps
          highlight how different types of real estate contribute to the overall
          housing market and which ones tend to have more consistent or more
          variable pricing.

          Please explore the visualizations and look out for the key takeaways
          from each of them as we explore the different factors and points of
          interest of Connecticut real estate. All of the visualizations
          throughout the project are interactive, so feel free to hover over
          different points to see more information about them.

        <h3>Number of Sales by Town/Zip Code</h3>
        <div class="viz-description">
          As we begin to explore all of the real estate data through my
          visualizations, the first thing I wanted to explore was
          <i>where</i> in Connecticut the most number of sales were happening.
          The map below shows the towns in Connecticut with sales (broken up by
          zip code) shaded in a blue color to represent the number of sales. A
          light shade of blue indicates a low number of sales, while a darker
          shade of blue indicates a higher number of sales. The map is
          interactive, so feel free to hover over different towns to see how
          many sales occurred in that area. You can also adjust the date range
          at the top of the visualization to see how the number of sales has
          changed over different time periods.

          The towns with the highest number of sales include Bridgeport,
          Stamford, and Waterbury. Towns with the fewest sales include Canaan,
          Norfolk, and Colebrook. From the map, we can see that most sales are
          concentrated in the southwestern and central parts of the state, while
          the northwestern region has significantly fewer. This is likely due to
          the southwestern area's higher population density, greater
          urbanization, and proximity to major cities like New York City.
