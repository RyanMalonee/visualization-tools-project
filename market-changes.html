        <h2>Exploring Market Changes Over Time</h2>
        <p>
          This section focuses on how real estate prices across Connecticut have
          changed year by year, and how those trends relate to other economic
          indicators like inflation or deflation. By looking at real estate data
          and Year-Over-Year changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U), we can
          observe patterns in how quickly home prices have risen or slowed down
          over time, how these changes compare to inflation, and how different
          property types have changed in value over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          These visualizations are designed to highlight major shifts in the
          market and help users better understand how sale prices and assessed
          values compare to inflation across different years.

        <h3>Median Sale Price vs. Median Assessed Value Over Time</h3>
        <div class="viz-description">
          The visualization below depicts the median sale prices of Connecticut
          real estate over the years, the median assessed values of those
          properties, and the difference between them. As you look at the
          visualization, you’ll notice a bar between the two lines representing
          the difference between sale price and assessed value. A larger bar
          indicates a larger difference. Hover over the visualization to view
          tooltip information including the sale year, median assessed value
          ($), median sale value ($), and the difference between them ($).

          After looking at the above visualization, we can see that the year
          with the largest difference between median sale price and median
          assessed value is 2023, with a gap of $162,460. This could be
          explained by a number of factors, including elevated home prices
          driven by limited housing supply in the aftermath of the COVID-19
          pandemic. (See the
          <a class="custom-link" href="resources.html#covid"
            >External Resources</a
          >
          page to learn more about the pandemic's impact.)
          <br />
          <br />
          2011 marks the year with the lowest difference between median sale
          price and median assessed value, with a gap of only $30,846. This
          could be explained by the fact that the housing market was still
          recovering from the
          <a href="resources.html#financial-crisis" class="custom-link">
            financial crisis</a
          >, which caused a significant drop in home prices and assessed values.
          As a result, the median sale price and median assessed value were able
          to become more closely aligned during this time.

        <h3>Year-Over-Year Change in Median Sale Prices</h3>
        <div class="viz-description">
          This line graph shows the Year-Over-Year change in median sale price
          for each property type from 2006 to 2023. It also includes a line
          (light grey) representing the Year-Over-Year change in the Consumer
          Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), helping highlight periods
          of inflation and deflation. When the CPI-U line rises above zero, it
          indicates increasing inflation compared to the previous year at the
          same time; when it dips below, it signals deflation or slowed
          inflation. By comparing these trends side-by-side, users can observe
          how different property types responded to broader economic conditions,
          such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic
          (highlighted in light red). Hover over the visualization to view
          tooltip information or alter the filters to get a better view of the

            >2008-2009 financial crisis</a
          >, the family homes (four family, three family, two family, and single
          family homes) were some of the property types hit the hardest. Three
          family homes had a -42.9% change in median sale prices compared to the
          year prior. At this same period of time, CPI-U was down -0.338% from
          the year prior. This indicates that the effects of the financial
          crisis were felt in Connecticut when it occurred. When we filter the
          data to only show those "family homes", we can see that, during
          2008-2009, three family homes were hit the hardest, followed by four
          family homes, and then two family homes. Single family homes were the
          least affected, but still saw a -13% change in 2008, and a -8.81%
          change in 2009.

        <h3>Sale Prices Over Time with CPI-U</h3>
        <div class="viz-description">
          This scatter plot shows the total sale amounts recorded in Connecticut
          from 1999 to 2023. Each green point represents a recorded property
          sale, while the yellow line displays the Year-Over-Year % change in
          the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The CPI-U
          line provides helpful context about periods of inflation and
          deflation, allowing users to compare how the economy may align with
          real estate activity over time. Users can interact with the filters on
          the right-hand side to explore the data in more detail. The “Sale
          Amount” filter can be used to remove outliers (such as extremely
          high-value sales) which may visually compress the rest of the graph.
          It’s also useful for viewing sales within a specific price range. The
          “Town” filter allows users to narrow the data by a specific location
          within Connecticut to observe trends in specific towns/areas.

          The visualization shows that the highest sale price recorded in
          Connecticut occurred in August 2021, with a sale price of
          $5,000,000,000 for apartments (serial number 20200091). In addition to
          this, we can see that from July 2015 on, the CPI-U Year-Over-Year %
          change has been above 0%, indicating inflation. The highest CPI-U
          Year-Over-Year % change occurred in June 2022, with a 9.06% increase.
          This is likely due to the economic recovery following the
          <a class="custom-link" href="resources.html#covid"
            >COVID-19 pandemic</a
          >, when consumer demand surged, supply chains were still disrupted,
          and inflation rose sharply across the country. If we filter the data
          down to just family home sales (single family, two family, three
          family, and four family properties), we see that the highest home
          price was $120,000,000 in April 2014, but most of the prices were
          under $20,000,000. When we continue to filter the data further, and
          set a max sale price of $20,000,000, we can see that there are a lot
          of sales in the $0 - $8,000,000 range, with fewer sales reaching as
          high up as $20,000,000. This is to be expected, as the majority of
          Americans would not be able to afford a home in the $20,000,000 range.
