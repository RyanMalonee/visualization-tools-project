        <h2>Exploring Market Changes Over Time</h2>
        <p>
          This section focuses on how real estate prices across Connecticut have
          changed year by year, and how those trends relate to broader economic
          indicators like inflation. By comparing housing data with the Consumer
          Price Index (CPI-U), we can observe patterns in how quickly home
          prices have risen or slowed down over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          These visualizations are designed to highlight major shifts in the
          market and help users better understand how sale prices and assessed
          values compare to inflation across different years.

        <h3>Median Sale Price vs. Median Assessed Value Over Time</h3>
        <div class="viz-description">
          The visualization below depicts the median sale prices of Connecticut
          real estate over the years, the median assessed values of those
          properties, and the difference between them. As you look at the
          visualization, youâ€™ll notice a bar between the two lines representing
          the difference between sale price and assessed value. A larger bar
          indicates a larger difference. Hover over the visualization to view
          tooltip information including the sale year, median assessed value
          ($), median sale value ($), and the difference between them ($).

          Looking at the visualization above, we can see that the most commonly
          sold property type, across all years available (4/5/1999 - 8/31/2023),
          is Single Family homes, with a total of 401,612 sales. This is
          followed quickly by <i>other</i> residential properties.
          Unsurprisingly, the second least common property type sold is
          industrial real estate, with only 774 sales recorded. This makes sense
          considering most individuals aren't in a position to purchase
          industrial-grade properties, which are typically owned by businesses.
          Their high median sale price, as seen in the
          <a href="#viz-2" class="custom-link">next visualization</a>, also
          contributes to their limited number of transactions. You'll also
          notice "Public Utility" is the least common property type sold, with
          only 10 sales recorded. This is likely due to the fact that public
          utilities are typically owned/managed by the government, or there are
          limited public utility properties available for sale across the state.
