        Three of the visualizations throughout the project relied on CPI-U
        measurements to try to track the Year-Over-Year % change in inflation
        and deflation. Periods of inflation, deflation, and recessions play a
        vital role in almost any market, and the real estate market is no
        different. Although the CPI-U data only goes back as far as 2006, and
        the Connecticut data only goes back to 1999, the CPI-U data is still
        useful in understanding different trends that may be visible in the
        visualizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two main events took place between 1999 and the present day, that led to
        periods of market downturn, or recessions. These include the COVID-19
        pandemic, and the 2008 financial crisis. The 2008 financial crisis was a
        result of the housing bubble and subprime mortgage crisis, which led to
        a significant decline in housing prices and a large number of
        foreclosures. These two events had a significant impact on the real
        estate market in Connecticut, as well as the rest of the country.
        Because of these events' huge impact on different market, I wanted to
        highlight them in the visualizations, so that the viewer could see how
        the market reacted to these events.
